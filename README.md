# About My 100 Days of Homelab Challenge

## What is the 100 Days of Homelab Challenge?

The **100 Days of Homelab Challenge** is an exciting initiative that encourages tech enthusiasts to build, experiment, and document their homelabs over a span of 100 days. Participants share their journey, from setup to problem-solving, while aiming to enhance their technical skills and knowledge in various areas of technology. You can learn more about the challenge at [100 Days of Homelab](https://100daysofhomelab.com/) and join the conversation using the hashtag **#100DaysOfHomelab**.

## What is a Homelab?

A **homelab** is a dedicated space, often within one's home, where individuals can create and manage a personal computing environment. It allows for experimentation with servers, networks, virtualization, and containers. Homelabs provide a hands-on opportunity to learn and implement technologies in a safe setting, making it an invaluable resource for aspiring IT professionals and hobbyists alike.

## My Goals for the Next 100 Days

During this challenge, I aim to focus on the following key areas:

- **GitOps**: I plan to deepen my understanding of GitOps practices, including how to manage infrastructure and application deployment using Git as a single source of truth.
  
- **Automation**: I will explore tools and frameworks that facilitate automation in my homelab, enhancing efficiency and consistency in operations.
  
- **Self-Hosting**: I am excited to learn about self-hosting various applications, leveraging containers, and managing these services securely.
  
- **Docker**: Throughout this challenge, I'll gain hands-on experience with Docker, focusing on containerization techniques and best practices.
  
- **Security**: A top priority will be ensuring that all setups and applications are secured, learning to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities in a homelab environment.
  
- **Documentation**: I aim to improve my documentation skills for my network, applications, and code, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for future reference.

By the end of these 100 days, I expect to have a more robust skill set in these areas, along with a documented journey that will serve as a useful resource for myself and the community.
